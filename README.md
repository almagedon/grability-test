# Marvin ★★

React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate.

Marvin is internal project by [Work & Co](https://work.co).
We love React and use it a lot. So Marvin is meant to be a starting point for our React projects.
But as we love open source too, it is publicly available for anyone interested in using it.

Name comes from a fictional character [Marvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_(character)), android from the [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) book as a homage to it's author [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams).
